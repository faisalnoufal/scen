            <h3>Course Description</h3>

            <p>The Certified Network Defender (CND) certification program focuses on creating Network Administrators who are trained on protecting,
                detecting and responding to the threats on the network. Network administrators are usually familiar with network components, traffic,
                performance and utilisation, network topology, location of each system, security policy, etc. A CND will get the fundamental understanding
                of the true construct of data transfer, network technologies, software technologies so that they understand how networks operate,
                understand what software is automating and how to analyse the subject material. In addition, network defence fundamentals, the application
                of network security controls, protocols, perimeter appliances, secure IDS, VPN and firewall configuration, intricacies of network traffic
                signature, analysis and vulnerability scanning are also covered which will help the Network Administrator design greater network security
                policies and successful incident response plans..</p>

            <p>CND is a skills-based, lab intensive program based on a job-task analysis and cybersecurity education framework presented by the National
                Initiative of Cybersecurity Education (NICE).</p>

            <h3>The purpose of the CND credential is to:</h3>
            <p>Validate the skills that will help the Network Administrators foster resiliency and continuity of operations during attacks.</p>

            <h3>About the Exam</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Number of Questions: 100</li>
                <li>Test Duration: 4 Hours</li>
                <li>Test Format: Multiple Choice</li>
                <li>Test Delivery: ECC EXAM</li>
                <li>Exam Prefix: 312-38 (ECC EXAM)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Passing Score</h3>
            <p>In order to maintain the high integrity of our certifications exams, EC-Council Exams are provided in multiple forms (I.e. different question banks).
                Each form is carefully analysed through beta testing with an appropriate sample group under the purview of a committee of subject matter experts that
                ensure that each of our exams not only has academic rigour but also has “real world” applicability. We also have a process to determine the difficulty
                rating of each question. The individual rating then contributes to an overall “Cut Score” for each exam form. To ensure each form has equal assessment
                standards, cut scores are set on a “per exam form” basis. Depending on which exam form is challenged, cut scores can range from 60% to 85%.</p>
            <h3>CERTIFIED NETWORK DEFENDER PROGRAM</h3>
            <p>Organisational focus on cyber defence is more important than ever as cyber breaches have a far greater financial impact and can cause broad reputational damage.
                Despite best efforts to prevent breaches, many organisations are still being compromised. Therefore organisations must have, as part of their defence mechanisms,
                trained network engineers who are focused on protecting, detecting, and responding to the threats on their networks.</p>
            <p>Network administrators spends a lot of time with network environments, and are familiar with network components, traffic, performance and utilisation,
                network topology, location of each system, security policy, etc.</p>
            <p>So, organisations can be much better in defending themselves from vicious attacks if the IT and network administrators equipped with adequate network
                security skills .Thus Network administrator can play a significant role in network defence and become first line of defence for any organisations.</p>
            <p>There is no proper tactical network security training that is made available for network administrators which provides them core network security skills.
                Students enrolled in the Certified Network Defender course, will gain a detailed understanding and hands on ability to function in real life situations
                involving network defence. They will gain the technical depth required to actively design a secure network in your organisation. This program will be akin
                to learning math instead of just using a calculator. This course gives you the fundamental understanding of the true construct of data transfer,
                network technologies, software technologies so that you understand how networks operate, understand what software is automating and how to analyse the subject material.</p>
            <p>You will learn how to protect, detect and respond to the network attacks. You will learn network defence fundamentals, the application of network security
                controls, protocols, perimeter appliances, secure IDS, VPN and firewall configuration. You will then learn the intricacies of network traffic signature,
                analysis and vulnerability scanning which will help you when you design greater network security policies and successful incident response plans.
                These skills will help you foster resiliency and continuity of operations during attacks.</p>
            <h3>The Most Comprehensive Network Defence Course in the World</h3>
            <p>This is the world’s most advanced Certified Network Defence course with 14 of the most current network security domains any individuals will ever want to
                know when they are planning to protect, detect, and respond to the network attacks.</p>
            <h3>About the Program</h3>
            <p>Certified Network Defender (CND) is a vendor-neutral, hands-on, instructor-led comprehensive network security certification training program.
                It is a skills-based, lab intensive program based on a job-task analysis and cybersecurity education framework presented by the National Initiative
                of Cybersecurity Education (NICE). The course has also been mapped to global job roles and responsibilities and the Department of Defence (DoD) job
                roles for system/network administrators. The course is designed and developed after extensive market research and surveys.</p>
            <p>The program prepares network administrators on network security technologies and operations to attain Defence-In-Depth network security preparedness.
                It covers the protect, detect and respond approach to network security. The course contains hands-on labs, based on major network security tools and
                techniques which will provide network administrators real world expertise on current network security technologies and operations.</p>
